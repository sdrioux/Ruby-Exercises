Ruby-Exercises
==============
This Repository contains three Ruby apps that I completed in my second week of MakerSquare[link:http://www.themakersquare.com].

1.  Simple, functional blackjack app that I created in my free time.  Does not take into account double-downs, splits, etc.  Users can hit or stand, after which the dealer will draw until he hits 16 or busts.

2.  Mine-sweeper app.  User can input the number of rows, columns, and mines they would like in their minefield.  App displays spaces that have already been selected with an X.  If user selects a space with a mine, they lose, and are prompted to play again.

3.  Sudoku solver.  Solves any 9x9 sudoku map, as long as the computer does not have to "guess" on any spaces in order to solve the puzzle.  Currently the sudoku needs to be added manually into the ruby script.
